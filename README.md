# 🎄❄️☃️🎅 Advent of Code - 2019 🎄❄️☃️🎅
[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) is a series of small programming puzzles.

This year, I've decided to solve them in [Go](https://golang.org/).

You can also see my [2018 repository](https://github.com/SwiftPush/advent-of-code-2018) and [2017 repository](https://github.com/SwiftPush/advent-of-code-2017).
